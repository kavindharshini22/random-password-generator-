import random

# Step 2: Greeting message
print("Welcome to Random Password Generator")

# Step 4: Ask user how many passwords should be generated
num_passwords = int(input("How many passwords would you like to generate? "))

# Step 5: Ask the length of each password
password_length = int(input("What should be the length of the password? "))

# Step 6: Print a header for the passwords
print(f"\nGenerating {num_passwords} passwords of length {password_length}:")

# Step 8: Use a for loop to generate each password
for i in range(num_passwords):
    # Step 10: Initialize an empty string for the password
    password = ""
    
    # Step 11: Use another for loop to generate random characters
    for j in range(password_length):
        # Step 12: Generate a random character and append to password
        password += random.choice("!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789")
    
    # Step 13: Print each generated password
    print(f"Password {i+1}: {password}")
